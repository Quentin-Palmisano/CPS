/**
 * The class <code>CachedComputer</code>  implements a cached computer
 * component that allows several threads to compute results of a computation
 * caching the results using appropriate concurrency control mechanisms.
 *
 * <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This example is taken and adapted from the following book:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * B. Goetz et al., Java Concurrency in Practice, Addison-Wesley (Pearson
 * Education), 2006.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This component implements in a generic way how a server component can
 * accelerate lengthy computations by caching results. This is a good
 * implementation to which a management of cached results over time should be
 * added not to let the cache grow indefinitely over time.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The basic idea is to use a hash map to cache already computed results.
 * However, managing concurrency is a bit complex if the objective is to favor
 * parallelism. The first decision is to use a <code>ConcurrentHashMap</code>
 * to store the computed results. The internal concurrency management of this
 * class already provides enough parallelism in the access to the hash map
 * for this example.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * However, the computations must guard themselves from computing the same
 * results many times. This could happen when two threads call the
 * <code>compute</code> method almost at the same time with the same argument.
 * In this case, both could see that their argument is not already in the hash
 * map and start parallel computations for it. Here, the proposed solution is
 * to store as soon as possible a future in the hash map, and allow subsequent
 * tasks to share the future with the first task computing the result for the
 * same argument and wait for this result before returning it to their caller.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The code of the method <code>compute</code> also caters for the possibility
 * that multiple threads may try to add the same future task in the hash map
 * when they all see that their argument is not present in the hash map.
 * Hence, after preparing the the future task, it is added to the hash map using
 * the atomic operation <code>putIfAbsent</code> that will return null if it
 * was not present and the already stored one otherwise, avoiding to have
 * several future tasks for the same arguments at the same time.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The results are kept in the hash map as futures even after the computation
 * ends. They will simply be accessed using the method <code>get</code>.
 * However, cancellations are still possible, so when cancelled the future
 * task associated with the computation is removed from the hash map and the
 * method <code>compute</code> retries all of the calls after removing the
 * particular cancelled future task from the hash map.
 * </p>
